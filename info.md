# Daikin Residential Controller (ONECTA) homeassistant integration
Cloud control of Daikin devices that are supported by Daikin Residential Controller (now "ONECTA - Daikin") app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration is no longer working since March 16th 2024 due to changes made by Daikin (see [https://github.com/rospogrigio/daikin_residential/issues/204](https://github.com/rospogrigio/daikin_residential/issues/182#issuecomment-1933967548)). Please migrate to the [daikin_onecta](https://github.com/jwillemsen/daikin_onecta) integration which supports the Daikin AC units but also other types of Daikin devices, such as the Daikin Altherma heat pumps.
